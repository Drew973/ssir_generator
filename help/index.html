<p>Set layer to this.<p>

<h4>Surveyed/Unsurveyed</h4>
<p>The Surveyed/Unsurveyed button will change the layer style to display surveyed and unsurveyed features differently.(rule based, features with a value in the "csv" field are considered to be surveyed).<p>


<h4>Changing site</h4>

<p> Change site to load an existing report or reset the form.<p>
<p> The plugin will try to load the csv in the "csv" field of the corresponding feature.<p>

<p>If the plugin cannot find a csv it will set the form. Default values for site details come from the feature.<p>
